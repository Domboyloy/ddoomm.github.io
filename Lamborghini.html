<h2>The Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance is America’s premier classic car show. Held in the beautiful Monterey Peninsula, California, every August, this exclusive event focuses on the display of gorgeous six-, seven-, and eight-figure vintage vehicles from the first three quarters of the 20th century. Because of this, it attracts a core audience of wealthy car lovers and collectors, as well as a broad selection of the automotive press.

    So it is no surprise—especially given the ongoing decline of the standard auto show—that it has also become a very prominent location for high-end automakers to unveil their latest concept and production cars. This year’s concours showed a significant expansion of this effort, with dozens of new vehicles making their premiere during the expanding multiverse of automotive events surrounding the concours, loosely known as Monterey Car Week. We checked out all of the premieres to bring you this comprehensive list.</h2>
